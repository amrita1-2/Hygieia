Add and Save Environments Funtionality: This tab will give this information

* Under the "Pipeline" tab, user will have the flexibility to ‘Add’ more environments and map them to their respective jenkins jobs and 'Save' this configuration. This will help with code tracibility across environments or answers the oft-asked question "what is deployed where?".
